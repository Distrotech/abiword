          <p>This is the source tree for the AbiSource desktop productivity tools,
namely the AbiWord word processor.
Everything contained here is copyrighted and is available for your use

COPYRIGHT.TXT and TRADEMARK.TXT for more information.</p>

<p>Current information is available at <a href="http://www.abisource.com/">http://www.abisource.com/</a>.</p>

<p>This tree contains the following top-level subdirectories:</p>

<p>src
    All source code is under here, including applications,
    library modules, and third-party source code.</p>

<p>ac-helpers
    Autoconf macros used by the autoconfiscated build system (configure).</p>

<p>docs
    Documents related to the project.  Includes specifications,
    design documents, and the like.  You should also find instructions
    for how to build the tree in here, within the "build" subdirectory.</p>

<p>po
    Localized strings for each locale we support, in PO format, as well
    as scripts for conversion to and from Abi's native .strings files,
    which are the files actually used directly by the program(s).  PO
    files are maintained as a convenience for translators, many of whom
    are already accustomed to working with them (as opposed to .strings).</p>

<p>regtest
    Regression testing tools (scripts, documents, and the like) reside
    here.</p>

<p>test
    Test files for AbiWord (not explicitly part of regression testing). </p>

<p>user
    Support files, other than code, which need to be installed
    on the user's machine, are stored in here.  Items which
    are too large to be practical do not necessarily go here,
    such as the fonts.</p>
